# Installing Lens

To install Lens, you can either use Open Lens, which we'd get from GitHub, clone the repo, and build it. 

You can use the Lens IDE, which you can get from k8slens.dev, download, and install, or you can simply use a Package Manager like Choco where you can run something like Choco Install Lens and you're done.

[Install Lens via snap Ubuntu](https://snapcraft.io/install/kontena-lens/ubuntu)

```bash
# Ubuntu 16.04 - 20.04 via snap
sudo snap install kontena-lens --classic
```
